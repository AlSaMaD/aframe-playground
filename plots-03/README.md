## Adding axis and tooltips

I'm going to add some functionality,
and to refactor the code a bit.
The result is two components:
`scatterplot`, which I already had,
and `tooltip`,
which I'm going to use to show tooltips close to the points
(spheres), when the pointer is on them.
I will also draw X, Y and Z axis in the plot.

The result, with a tooltip shown, is like this:

![Scatterplot with axis and tooltip](scatterplot-axis-tooltip.png)

You can also [see it live](web/)

The code for this step is available in the `plots-03` directory.

### Adding axis

### The tooltip component

### Everything together
