# Some notes while learning about A-frame

These are my notes,
taken while learning about A-frame.
Maybe they could be useful to others,
but your mileage may vary...

In any case,
feel free to pull request if you find errors,
or if you have cool ideas to improve some of the steps.
But keep in mind that it is just a simple guide,
to start with A-frame from scratch.

I'm using 0.6.1, which is current when I'm starting my learning process
(although documentation refers to 0.6.0).

Now, the notes:

* [First steps in creating an A-frame scene](figures-01/README.md)
* [Simple configuration for webpack](figures-02/README.md)
* [Improving webpack configuration](figures-03/README.md)

## Back to A-frame

Once I'm happy with webpack configuration,
let's go back to A-frame.
Focus. Focus! Focus!!

Did I say I need some focus?

I will work now on directory `figures-04`.
