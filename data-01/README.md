## Visualizing data

Now, I'm going to work in `data-01`,
visualizing some data points with a scatterplot
(each dot will be an sphere).

### Generating dist files and running everything

As we saw in the previous section, the complete process to build the project is:

```
$ cd data-01
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

This will build everything,
you will only need a browser to see the resulting scene.

### Results

Check the resulting [virtual reality scene](web/index.html).
