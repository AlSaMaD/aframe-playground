## Visualizing data

Now, I'm going to work in `data-02`,
visualizing some data points with a scatterplot
(each dot will be an sphere), with an axis.
But now, I will be using A-frame components
for the spheres and the axis.

We will follow the documentation in
[Writing a component](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/introduction/writing-a-component.html)

### Generating dist files and running everything

As we saw in the previous section, the complete process to build the project is:

```
$ cd data-02
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

This will build everything,
you will only need a browser to see the resulting scene.

### Results

Check the resulting [virtual reality scene](web/index.html).
